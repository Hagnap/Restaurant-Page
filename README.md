# Restaurant-Page

## Description
This project is the creation of a fictional pizza restaurant's website where I got to use Webpack in a project for the first time. I wasn't too concerned with the design of this website, I was focused on learning how to set up and use Webpack on a project. It was a bit difficult at first getting it set up and getting used to it, I go over this in some more depth in *Challenges Faced*. During the course of this project I found myself creating more HTML via JavaScript than actually coding the HTML by hand and I found that interesting as it is common for developers to do when using React and other JavaScript frameworks/libraries. Another thing I noticed while working on this project was that my CSS files are still very unorganized, my goal for my next project is to have a better organized CSS file. The layout of this website was made using both Flexbox and Grid.

## Challenges Faced
Creating Content
    - I did not have any good ideas for the hero message for this webpage, so I resorted to using ChatGPT to create this. I gave it the following prompt: `Create a hero message for a pizza restaurant that talks about how much the restaurant values their family recipe and their excellent customer service. Also add a few sentences how the restaurant was created by a mom and pop about 30 years ago and it has been a staple in their community since then`

 - After being pleased with the result of the query above I used another query to create names & descriptions for the pizzas on the menu. I gave it the following prompt: `List the ten most popular types of pizzas with a brief description of each one`

Background Image

- This was my first time using CSS to add a background image, I knew this was possible but always used background colors and not images. It was a bit of a challenge getting it to only be at the top and to look *nice*. However, after a brief google search I found some helpful resources.

Webpack

- This is something that is new to me so it was a challenge having to adjust to a new workflow. At the start I found myself referring to the [tutorial](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) I did prior to this project but as I went on in the project that began to decrease. However, this is a simple usage of webpack I imagine a project of larger scale will be more of a challenge (or learning experience depending on how you want to look at it).
